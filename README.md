# openGrazier

openGrazier is an application which is implemented on ethereum blockchain.

It aims at the evolution of a new type of supply chain management system of the crops grown by the farmer.
In India, there are a number of intermediaries in food supply chain due to which farmers are greatly effected. There is no transparency in the system and also the corrupt intermediaries steal the right of our farmers.

So we developed openGrazier which solves all these problems.
As it is implemented on blockchain, therefore no intermediaries are involved and also the system is transparent.

Thus it overall helps in betterment of farmers.
